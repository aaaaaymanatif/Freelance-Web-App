                                    <p>I studied Information Technology (IT) and computing in my academic journey, and I
                                        believe that these two fields are incredibly important and have had a

                                        impact on modern society. In today's world, technology is integrated into almost
                                        every aspect of our lives, and IT has become a crucial part of managing and

                                        gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing IT systems,

                                    <p class="article-container-date">September 2016, September 2017</p>

                                    <p>I had the privilege of working remotely with Veelio, a company that specializes
                                        in
                                        creating software solutions powered by artificial intelligence (AI). During my
                                        time
                                        with
                                        Veelio, I collaborated with a talented team of developers and designers to
                                        create
                                        innovative software applications that utilized cutting-edge AI technologies.
                                        Together,
                                        we worked on several projects that involved developing intelligent chatbots,
                                        voice
                                        assistants, and predictive analytics tools. I gained valuable experience in
                                        software
                                        development and AI programming, as well as in working remotely with a team
                                        across
                                        different time zones. Through this experience, I learned how to effectively
                                        communicate
                                        and collaborate with team members, manage project timelines, and deliver
                                        high-quality
                                        software solutions that met the clients' needs. Overall, my time with Veelio was
                                        a
                                        challenging and rewarding experience that helped me grow both personally and
                                        professionally in the field of software development and AI.</p>

                                    <p>I worked with a remote company called Grosomodo to develop mobile apps. It was an
                                        exciting opportunity to work with talented individuals who are passionate about
                                        mobile
                                        app development. We collaborated closely to ensure that the final product meets
                                        the
                                        client's requirements and is user-friendly. As a developer, I was responsible
                                        for
                                        implementing the app's functionality and ensuring that it runs smoothly across
                                        different
                                        devices. I used a variety of programming languages and tools to create
                                        responsive
                                        and
                                        efficient apps that provide an excellent user experience. Working remotely
                                        allowed
                                        us to
                                        communicate effectively and share our progress regularly, resulting in a
                                        successful
                                        collaboration that produced high-quality mobile apps.</p>

                                        and
                                        won first place. It was a good competition that required us to develop a

                                        application within a short timeframe. My team and I worked tirelessly for days

                                        an innovative and functional app that would impress the judges. We put our

                                        the

                                        statement given to us. The moment we were announced as the winners, we were
                                        filled
                                        with
                                        an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and pride. This experience taught me the
                                        value
                                        of hard work, collaboration, and perseverance, and I have carried these lessons
                                        with
                                        me
                                        ever since.</p>

                                    <p class="article-container-date">In 2018</p>

                                    <p>Arabnet is a highly competitive tech conference and start-up competition that
                                        attracts
                                        top talent from across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. In 2019,
                                        I
                                        had
                                        the opportunity to participate in the Arabnet Beirut event as part of a team of
                                        innovative and talented individuals. We spent months developing a cutting-edge
                                        technology solution and refining our pitch, all in the hopes of winning the top
                                        prize
                                        and gaining recognition from the regional tech community. After a grueling
                                        competition
                                        that lasted several rounds and involved dozens of other talented teams, we were
                                        thrilled
                                        to be ranked third overall. While we didn't take home the top prize, we were
                                        incredibly
                                        proud of our achievement and the recognition that it brought us. Competing in
                                        Arabnet
                                        was a valuable experience that pushed us to our limits, challenged us to think
                                        creatively, and helped us hone our skills as tech innovators. It was a true
                                        testament to
                                        the power of collaboration, hard work, and determination.</p>
